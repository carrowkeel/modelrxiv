		<h3>Privacy Policy</h3>
		<p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> November 4th 2024</p>
		<p><strong>1. Data Collection and Use</strong><br>
		Registration is required to submit content to modelRxiv. During registration, we collect an arbitrary username and password solely for authentication purposes. No other personal data is required or collected at this stage. The information you provide is stored securely and is only used to facilitate your access to our services.</p>
		<p><strong>2. Content Submission</strong><br>
		All content submitted to modelRxiv, including named contributors, code, and any associated information, is considered public domain upon submission. Please ensure you have the legal rights to publish this information. By submitting your content, you consent to its release and take full responsibility for any infringement of copyright or other laws regarding the content you upload.</p>
		<p><strong>3. Data Security</strong><br>
		We use industry-standard security measures to protect your data. However, we do not control and cannot ensure the security of data collected by intermediaries like content distribution networks, relays, or ISPs. Please note that we store only non-personal and non-sensitive data.</p>
		<p><strong>4. AI-Assisted Features</strong><br>
		If you choose to use our AI-assisted features, your code and related content will be submitted to OpenAI's API services to facilitate model conversion. Additionally, this data will be stored on our servers indefinitely for logging purposes and to improve our conversion pipeline and conduct research on model conversion. By clicking the "auto-convert" button that launches AI-assisted features, you consent to this usage and data processing. If you do not consent, please refrain from using these features.</p>
		<p><strong>5. Third-Party Services</strong><br>
		We do not share your data with third parties except as necessary for hosting and maintaining our services, which includes using third-party APIs like OpenAI for AI-assisted features, or as required by law. For more information on how OpenAI handles your data, please refer to their <a href="https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a> and <a href="https://openai.com/policies/api-data-usage-policies">API Data Usage Policies</a>.</p>
		<p><strong>6. Data Retention</strong><br>
		We retain your data indefinitely to provide our services, improve our conversion pipeline, and conduct research on model conversion. The code submitted through AI-assisted features will be stored securely and used solely for the purposes outlined in this policy.</p>
		<p><strong>7. User Rights</strong><br>
		Since we do not collect personal data beyond an arbitrary username, and all submitted content is intended for public release, we do not offer mechanisms for data access, correction, or deletion. If you have concerns about your privacy, please contact us at <a href="mailto:contact@modelrxiv.org">contact@modelrxiv.org</a>.</p>
		<p><strong>8. Changes to This Policy</strong><br>
		We reserve the right to modify this policy at any time. Changes will be posted on this site with an updated effective date. Your continued use of our services constitutes your acceptance of these changes.</p>
		<p><strong>9. Contact Information</strong><br>

		<p><strong>10. Cookies and Local Storage</strong><br>
		We use localStorage to store login tokens with no personal information. This is used to allow registered users to upload models. Regular visitors to the site do not have any session data stored.</p>
		<p><strong>11. User Responsibility</strong><br>
		Please upload only content that you have the right to publish and that does not contain sensitive or personal information. We are not responsible for any infringement of copyright or other laws resulting from the content you upload. Our AI pipeline is trained to identify abuse and will reject such requests.</p>
		<p><strong>12. Governing Law</strong><br>
		This privacy policy and the use of our services are governed by the laws applicable in our jurisdiction.</p>
